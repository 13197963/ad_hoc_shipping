# AD HOC SHIPPING


## FOLDER STRUCTURE

The **code** folder contains the gnuradio and python files needed to make the system operate.

Installation instructions are in the **documentation** folder, as is the format for packets.

Testing Gnuradio Flowcharts are in the **grc_flowgraphs** folder.

It is necessary to keep the *addressControl.py* and *shippingControl.py* files with the automatically generated *gnuShipping.py* file.
